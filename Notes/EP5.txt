Export Default vs Named Exports (Curly braces to import)
export default component -- import component from "path"
export const component  -- import {component} from "path"

Can have both named and default export in a single file ideally main component as "export default component"
and other minor things as "export const component"


React - Faster DOM Manipulation, Diffing

Hooks :
- useState()  -  Maintains state of the component - Whenever a state variable updates/changes, react re-renders the component
- useEffect() -


React Fiber - > Reconciliation Algorithm also known as React Fiber (React 16)
  - New way of finding the Diff and updating the DOM - 
  - Incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread over multiple frames
Virtual DOM - Representation of the actual DOM -> (Virtual DOM- Kind of Object Representation)
 - Existed long before react, but react built it's core algorithm around virtual dom
Diff Algorith - Finds out the difference between the updated virtual DOM and the original virtual DOM
